              Delivering on time requires a high degree of flexibility. Timely delivery not only means the physical delivery of equipment, but also the timely delivery of information.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              The quantities of equipment models required often changes both before and during a project. And when the requested additional equipment is no longer available, offering alternatives is essential. That is why communication with customers and therefore the market is necessary to be able to deliver on time. Flexibility and customer focus are the basic concepts.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              It is imperative that equipment that is supplied must meet the requirements of the project. It must do what is expected in extreme circumstances and therefore must be well maintained. In addition, the equipment must be easy to operate and maintain on the jobsite, whilst also meeting local requirements worldwide By taking this into consideration in terms of design, choice of parts and suppliers and also in terms of knowledge and expertise in maintenance and assembly, the customer receives the machines on which he can build and trust. We call this Quality.
